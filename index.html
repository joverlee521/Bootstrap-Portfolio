                        <p class="m-2">My name "Jover" is translated from the Chinese phrase <span lang="zh">娇娃</span>(jiāo wá), which roughly translates to "angels". During my free time I love to play video games, mostly role-playing games or RPGs. Although video games have a bad reputation in mass media, I believe that they are just a misunderstood artform. The most popular games such Fortnite or Call of Duty are games for pure entertainment and do not elevate the medium. There are other games such as Nier: Automata that contains a story that can only be told through the video game format. The player becomes part of the story and gets to experience the tribulation and frustrations of the characters firsthand. It is my goal to become part of the video game industry that creates this art.</p>

                        <p>I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2015 with B.S. in Molecular Toxicology. I was able to get a job as a lab assistant in an IVF clinic due to my past experience in clean labs during internships in college. From there I was promoted to a junior embryologist and had the privilege of being part of the artificial baby making process. It was a very lucrative and interesting job, but my love for video games prompted me to try to learn coding on the side. However, my self-study sessions were not very successful and caused me to look into other routes for learning coding. I was introduced to coding bootcamps via a friend from college who had a computer science background. I believed that this would be an opportunity for me to have a fresh so I decided to move to a completely new city to begin a new journey!</p>
